to make industry less destructive
0:02
activities such as reduce avoid minimize
0:06
sustain limit and hurt have long been on
0:10
the main agendas of the environmentalist
How did it all start?
0:12
but how did they start as the industry
0:15
spread people started noticing changes
0:18
in nature at the end of the 18th century
0:21
thomas malthus an influential economist
0:24
published a book an essay on the
0:26
principle of population predicting the
0:29
exponential growth of human population
0:31
and warning that it would bring
0:33
devastating consequences for humankind
0:35
it was at the time when population
0:38
growth was viewed as a positivity jurors
0:41
perkins mars as some consider him the
0:44
father of the environmental movement was
0:46
one of the first to understand man's
0:49
capacity for lasting destruction on the
0:51
environment his most famous book man and
0:55
nature published in 1864 highlighted the
0:58
importance of a harmonious relationship
1:00
between the human kind and the natural
1:02
world and warned of the negative impact
1:05
if natural resources is used up too
1:07
quickly
1:08
the book made an enormous positive
1:10
impact on the foresters artists thinkers
1:14
and conservationists later aldo leopold
1:18
an ecologist and naturalist expressed
1:20
some feelings of guilt in his
1:22
publication he wrote when i submit these
1:25
thoughts to a printing press i'm helping
1:27
cut down the rules when i pour cream in
1:30
my coffee
1:31
i'm helping to train a mass for cows to
1:34
kids and to exterminate the birds of
1:36
brazil
1:37
when i go birding or hunting in my fall
1:40
i am devastating and all filled and
1:43
reelecting and imperialism to get me
1:46
rubble no more when i father more than
1:49
two children i'm creating as incessable
1:52
need for more printing presses more cows
1:55
more coffee more oil to supply with more
1:59
birds more trees and more flowers will
2:01
either be killed or evicted from their
2:04
several environments as a result
2:07
conservation societies such as sierra
2:09
club and the wilderness society were
2:11
established that helped preserve
2:13
wilderness and keep it safe from
2:15
industrial growth the definition of
2:18
environmentalism at that time was very
2:20
limited though it was mainly about
2:22
protesting deforestation mining
2:24
destruction factory pollution and other
2:27
visible changes and seeking to preserve
2:30
specially appreciated landscapes however
2:33
it wasn't until really later the
2:35
publications of rachel carson's silent
2:38
spring in 1962 when she pointed out that
2:42
human-made chemicals particularly
2:44
pesticides such as ddt were bad for the
2:46
natural world almost a decade later
2:49
silent spring led to the banning of ddt
2:52
in the united states and germany
2:55
serially scientists and politicians
2:57
formed groups such as environmental
2:59
defense the natural resources defense
3:02
council the world wildlife federation
3:04
and the boon that's the german
3:06
federation for environmental and nature
3:09
conservation by this point
3:11
environmentalists were no longer only
3:13
interested to preserve but in monitoring
3:16
and reducing toxins shortly after asylum
3:19
spring in 1968 paul airlie a pioneer of
3:23
modern environmentalism and an eminent
3:25
biologist published the population bomb
3:28
in which he predicted that
3:30
1970s and 1980s would see a resource so
3:34
it is expecting the death of hundreds of
3:36
millions of people additionally he also
3:39
pointed out humans habit of using
3:41
atmosphere as a garbage dump he asked
3:45
what do we gain by playing environmental
3:47
drillers
3:48
in 1972 daniela and dennis meadows and
3:51
the club of rome published another
3:53
serious warning the limits to growth the
3:56
authors noted that resources were
3:58
depleting due to population growth and
4:00
concluded if the present growth trends
4:02
in world population industrialization
4:05
pollution food production and resource
4:08
education continue unchanged the limit
4:10
to growth on this planet will risk
4:12
sometime within the next 100 years in
4:15
1984 airlie published another book with
4:18
his wife annie the population explosion
4:22
stating then the fuse was burning now
4:25
the population bomb has detonated they
4:27
pointed out the primary cause of our
4:30
planets and aids is the overgrowth of
4:32
the human population and its impact on
4:34
both ecosystem and human communities
4:37
as this environmentalists were issuing
4:39
an important warning suggestions were
4:42
being made the ways consumers could
4:44
reduce their negative impact on the
4:45
environment in 1998 book useless stuff
4:50
environmental solutions for who we
4:52
really are robert linfield and william
4:55
ratz mentioned the best way to reduce
4:58
any environmental impacts is not to
5:00
recycle more but to produce and dispose
5:02
of less but industry was not listening
5:05
to them and it stayed like this until
5:07
the industry began to realize the harm
5:10
they were creating and it wasn't until
5:12
decades later in a response the rio
5:15
earth summit happened in 1992 where
5:18
approximately 30 000 people from 167
5:22
countries gathered in rio de janeiro the
5:25
group's report stressed the importance
5:27
of eco-efficiency for all companies that
5:30
aim to be competitive sustainable and
5:32
successful in the long term by making
5:34
the machines that has cleaner faster
5:37
fighter engines although many big
5:39
corporations such as 3m and johnson and
5:42
johnson adopted the term in their
5:44
business models to their disappointment
5:46
the definition of ecosystem was too big
5:49
now let's try to understand what exactly
5:51
is echo efficiency the definition equal
What is Eco-Efficiency?
5:54
efficiency means doing more with less
5:57
but that still doesn't say much right
5:59
how much of a less is less to understand
6:01
this let's look at the famous
6:02
environmental movement that is 4 hours
6:05
reduce reuse recycle and regulate
6:09
reduce
Reduce
6:11
whether it's a matter of eliminating
6:13
toxic waste or cutting down the use of
6:15
raw materials the reduction is one of
6:17
the main point of equi-efficiency but
6:19
having said that the reduction does not
6:22
stop depletion and destruction
6:24
completely in fact it only slows them
6:26
down
Reuse
6:27
reuse
6:28
another voice reduction strategy is
6:31
incineration which has better reputation
6:33
than land filling due to waste to energy
6:36
conversion but waste in incinerator burn
6:39
only because valuable materials like
6:41
paper and plastic are flammable for once
6:44
we have to think that since these
6:46
materials were never designed to be
6:48
safely burned they release toxins
6:50
although many industries and customers
6:52
feel good if they find a way to reuse
6:54
waste but in many cases this waste and
6:57
many toxins are simply being transferred
6:59
to another place unless materials are
7:01
specifically designed to ultimately
7:03
become safe food for nature even
7:06
biodegradable waste when composted can
7:08
release the chemicals and toxins in the
7:10
materials
7:12
recycling
Recycle
7:14
now let's talk about recycling most
7:16
recycling is actually down cycling which
7:19
means it reduces the quality of material
7:22
over time for example the high quality
7:24
steel used in automobiles is recycled by
7:28
melting it down with other purpose
7:30
including copper paints and plastic as a
7:33
result the quality of material goes down
7:36
to make up for the lost quality more
7:39
high quality steel may be added to make
7:41
the hybrid strong enough for the next
7:43
use but still it will not provide the
7:46
same material properties to make a new
7:48
car again another good example is a soda
7:51
can which consists of two kinds of
7:53
aluminium the wall is composed of
7:55
aluminium magnesium alloy with some
7:58
magnesium plus coating and paint while
8:00
the harder top is aluminium magnesium
8:03
alloy now imagine what happens when
8:06
these materials are mixed together their
8:08
properties change that's exactly what
8:10
happens in conventional recycling these
8:13
materials are melted together in order
8:15
to be recycled and resulting in a weaker
8:18
and less useful product lost value and
8:20
lost materials are not only concerned
8:23
here one good example is of plastics
8:26
when some plastics are melted and
8:27
combined the polymers in the plastics
8:30
the chains that make it strong and
8:32
flexible are sorted since the material
8:34
properties of this recycled plastic are
8:37
altered chemical and mineral additives
8:39
may be added to attain the desired
8:41
performance quality as a result down
8:44
cycle plastic may have more additives
8:46
than virgin waste and last but not least
8:49
recycling is actually more expensive
8:52
because it tries to force materials into
8:55
more lifetime than they were originally
8:57
designed for hence requiring more energy
9:00
and resources
Regulate
9:02
regulate
9:03
regulate means we all have to remember
9:06
our responsibilities be it the
9:08
government or the public do we need a
9:11
stronger law or can we just be a nice
9:13
person and follow the three r rules but
9:16
the problem is there is an enough
9:17
guidance for the public the explanation
9:20
of how to save the environment is as big
9:22
as the definition of equation
9:25
equal efficient is a definitely
9:27
admirable concept but it is not a
9:29
strategy to success over a long time
9:31
because it does not read deep enough
9:34
relying on efficiency to save the
9:36
environment will in fact achieve the
9:38
opposite it will let the industry finish
9:40
up everything quietly persistently and
9:43
completely now let's look at how it
9:45
would look like if we design a system
9:47
with keeping eco-efficient in mind
9:50
release fewer pounds of toxic waste
9:52
every year
9:54
measure prosperity by this activity
9:57
meet the conditions of thousands of
9:59
regulations to keep people and natural
10:02
system from being poisoned too quickly
10:05
produce fewer materials that are so
10:07
dangerous that they will require future
10:09
generations to maintain constant
10:11
vigilance while living in terror
10:14
result in smaller amount of useless
10:17
waste
10:18
put a smaller amount of valuable
10:20
materials in holes all over the planet
10:22
where they can never be retrieved
Efficient- at what?
10:26
efficient at what here's a nice example
10:30
in germany 20 years ago the standard
10:32
rate of oil used for heating and cooling
10:35
the average house was 30 liters per
10:38
square meter per year today with high
10:40
efficient housing it is 1.5 liters of
10:43
oil for a square meter this increase in
10:46
efficiency is often achieved due to
10:48
better installation and smaller
10:50
leak-proof windows although this
10:52
strategy are meant to optimize the
10:54
system and reduce wasted energy this
10:56
actually reduces air exchange rates
10:58
which intensifies the concentration of
11:01
indoor air pollution from poorly
11:03
designed materials
11:05
another example from turkey shows that
11:07
efficient building can also be dangerous
11:10
several years ago turkey's government
11:12
designed and constructed inexpensive
11:14
housing which were built efficiently
11:16
with a minimum of steel and concrete
11:19
during 1999 earthquakes this building
11:22
easily collapsed while other inefficient
11:24
buildings held up better what about
11:26
agriculture in the past
11:28
efficient agriculture is seen depleting
11:31
local landscape and wildlife take a look
11:33
at the example of germany again during
11:35
the time when there were west ceremony
11:37
and east germany the waste produced
11:39
double the amount of wheat per acre than
11:42
east because agriculture industry in the
11:44
west was more efficient and modern
11:47
however the eastern efficient and more
11:49
old-fashioned agriculture was actually
11:51
better for the environment as it has
11:53
larger wetland areas that have not been
11:56
drained and overtaken by monocultural
11:58
crops and they contain more rare species
12:02
last but not least this does not mean
12:04
efficient is bad at all wine being
12:06
implemented as a tool within a larger
12:09
efficient system that intends overall
12:11
positive effects on a wide range of
12:14
issues eco-efficiency can actually be a
12:16
valuable one it can be used as to slow
12:19
down current system and turn around
12:22
so what do we do we should make the goal
12:24
where there is zero waste
12:26
zero emissions
12:28
and zero ecological footprint thank you
12:30
for watching in the next sector we go
12:32
deep into eco-effectiveness
